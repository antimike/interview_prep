# Iterated logarithm

## Super-logarithm

Exponentiation can be "inverted" by roots or logarithms, depending on which variable is held constant (base or exponent).  Similarly, *tetration* ("tower of powers") can be "inverted" by either
* the **super-root**, or
* the **super-logarithm**.

### Hyperoperations

Note that tetration is the fourth element in the chain of *hyperoperations* built up iteratively from the primitive "successor" operation.

Hyperoperation (recursive definition)
: Let $$[n]$$ denote the nth hyperoperation.  Then
: $$a[n]b = a [n-1] (a[n](b-1))$$.
