# Complexity classes

## NP

**Fagin's Theorem**
: NP == the set of languages expressible by sentences of existential second-order logic[^DescrCompWiki]

## PH

* Union of all classes in the polynomial hierarchy
* Equivalent to the set of languages expressible using second-order logic[^DescrCompWiki]

## k-EXP

k-EXP
: DTIME(2^^k), where "^^" indicates tetration

## ELEMENTARY

* Elementary recursive functions
* Describes precisely the languages that correspond to a formula in higher-order logic
    * This class is also sometimes called HO ("higher-order")
* Union of k-EXP for all natural numbers k
