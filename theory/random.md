## Schr≈ìder's equation

* Eigenvalue equation for composition operator:
\[ \Psi(h(z)) = s \Psi(z) \]
* Applications:
    * Nonlinear dynamics and chaos
    * Turbulence
    * Renormalization group
    * Gives a way of generalizing discrete iterative maps to continuous or complex values of the iterative parameter[^SchrWiki]

## Fatou components and sets

* Complimentary to Julia set(s)[^FatouWiki]

## Infinite Composition of Analytic Functions (ICAF)

* Can be used to give alternate representations to continued fractions, infinite sums / products, etc.
* Fixed point / contraction theorem[^ICAFWiki]

## Euler continued fraction identity

* General equality between finite sums of a certain form and finite continued fractions
* Can be used to derive continued fraction representations of $$\pi$$ (e.g.)[^EulerFracWiki]

## Carleman matrix

* Gives nice computational methods for computing function iterates[^CarlemanWiki]

## Higher-order logic

* Has connections to type theory[^HOLWiki]
